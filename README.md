# Project Preparation

## Project Requirements

Before starting the project, ensure that you have the following requirements in place:

- Python version 3.8 or higher (Make sure to select "Add Python to PATH" during installation to enable easy access)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as VSCode or PyCharm
- Virtual Environment:
  - Install the `virtualenvwrapper-win` library by running the command: `pip install virtualenvwrapper-win`

## Setting up the Project

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal to set up and activate the virtual environment.
2. Create a new virtual environment (if needed) by running the command: `mkvirtualenv 550` (You can use an existing virtualenv as well).
3. Activate the virtual environment by running: `workon 550`.
4. Navigate to the directory where the "contents" file is located.
   - Change the directory (cd) to the appropriate location: `cd path/to/contents`.
5. Install the required packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (This command will download the necessary packages for Robot Framework testing).

## Extension Installations (optional but preferable)

Consider installing the following extensions to enhance your development experience:

- Python Extension for your IDE.
- Robot Framework Language Server:
  - Configure the extension settings by setting the "Robot â€º Language-server: Python" path to the location of your Python interpreter, e.g., "C:\Users\beyn\Envs\550\Scripts\python.exe".

## Running the Program

- To execute the program, run the following command:
`python main.py`

- To run all the tests, use the following command:
`robot -d result rf_code_basic\tests\api`

## Code
The provided code consists of several functions that serve different purposes:

1. /login (POST):

- Purpose: Handles user login/authentication.
- Request method: POST
- Parameters: Expects a JSON payload containing the "username" and "password" fields.
- Returns: If the provided username and password match the predefined values ("admin" and "masterPass"), it generates a token and returns it in the response body along with a status code of 200. Otherwise, it returns a 401 status code.

2. /users (GET):

- Purpose: Retrieves a list of all users.
- Request method: GET
- Parameters: Accepts an optional query parameter called "filter" (e.g., /users?filter=all).
- Returns: If the "filter" query parameter is set to "all," it retrieves all users from the JSON database and returns them in the response body with a status code of 200. Otherwise, it returns an empty response body with a status code of 200.

3. /users (POST):

- Purpose: Creates a new user.
- Request method: POST
- Parameters: Expects a JSON payload containing user data, including the "contracts" field, which should contain an array of contract objects.
- Returns: If the number of contracts is between 1 and 3 and the user data is valid, it generates a random ID, adds the user to the JSON database, and returns the generated ID in the response body with a status code of 201. If the data is invalid or the number of contracts is not within the allowed range, it returns an error message with a status code of 400.

4. /users/{id} (DELETE):

- Purpose: Deletes a user with the specified ID.
- Request method: DELETE
- Parameters: Expects a path parameter called "id" that specifies the ID of the user to be deleted.
- Returns: If a user with the specified ID exists, it removes the user from the JSON database and returns a success message with a status code of 200. If the ID is not an integer or no user with the specified ID is found, it returns an error message with a status code of 400 or 404, respectively.

5. /users/{id} (GET):

- Purpose: Retrieves information about a specific user.
- Request method: GET
- Parameters: Expects a path parameter called "id" that specifies the ID of the user to retrieve.
- Returns: If a user with the specified ID exists, it retrieves the user's information from the JSON database and returns it in the response body with a status code of 200. If the ID is not an integer or no user with the specified ID is found, it returns an error message with a status code of 400 or 404, respectively.
The code also includes error handlers for the 404 (Not Found) and 401 (Unauthorized) status codes, which return appropriate error messages.
